# DevLightbox
Build a lightbox feature using jQuery

#The Setting:
We have a client who wants us to build them a webpage to feature their artwork. They want it to be simple, elegant, and, above all, easy to use.

#The Problems:
1) When the user clicks on an image, they are taken to a new, unstyled webpage.<br>
2) The website isn't easy to use because of the navigation problems. <br>
3) The user should stay on the original page when they click on the image to improve the UX.<br>
4) The client wants it to resemble a gallery - they want the rest of the screen to darken and show the image the user clicked on larger and in the center of the page.<br>

#The Tasks:
1) Add image to overlay<br>
2) Add caption to overlay<br>
3) Add overlay to body of the DOM<br>
4) Capture the click event when user clicks on image<br>
5) When user clicks on an image, update the overlay with the selected image<br>
6) Show overlay when image is clicked<br>
7) Set the caption of the image being featured<br>
8) When the user clicks outside of the featured image, hide the overlay<br>
